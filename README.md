## Business Answer
## Summary and Next Steps 

## Background Information
For this project, I chose to analyze Baltimore City, MD and Chicago, IL (hometown). 
The explored metric is employment rates (%) based on parent income (high, medium, and low). This is interesting to me, because I wanted to know if parent income can have an effect on employment rates and whether preconceptions about economic disparities hold true. 

## Business Question
How does parent income contribute to employment rates in Baltimore and Chicago and what are the key differences between the two cities?

## Data Sources
[Baltimore City Employment Data](https://github.com/matthewprk/comparing_employment_data_in_baltimore_city_and_chicago/blob/master/Chicago%20Employment%20Data.xls0) - This dataset shows employment data for Baltimore City based on parent income. 

[Chicago Employment Data](https://github.com/matthewprk/comparing_employment_data_in_baltimore_city_and_chicago/blob/master/Baltimore%20City%20Employment%20Data.xls) - This dataset shows employment data for Chicago based on parent income.

[Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) - This is the website from which tract datasets on employment rates and parent income were originally pulled from.

## Data Analysis and Metrics
### Metric Explored: Employment Rates - This is the % of people employed divided by the labor force. 
- 1 The average employment rate in Baltimore is 71.48%. 
- 2 The average employment rate in Chicago is 74.41%. 
- 3 In Baltimore, employment for people with high-income parents is 78.00%, middle-income parents is 74.51%, and low-income parents is 69.06%.
- 4 In Chicago, employment for people with high-income parents is 76.98%, middle-income parents is 76.40%, and low-income parents is 71.74%.

### Employment Rates Segmented by Parent Income Visualiztion

This shows the difference in employment rates for Baltimore and Chicago, segmented by parent income. Here, we see that Baltimore's employment rate for people with low-income parents is ~2% lower than Chicago's and could be driving a lower overall employment rate. 

## Conclusion
### Summary of Findings
Parent income affects employment rates. Generally, average employment rate increases as parent income increases for both cities, though we cannot assert causation. Baltimore's employment rate for people with low-income parents is lower than Chicago's, which could be driving lower overall employment. 

### Next Steps
The next steps are to look at why parent income influences employment rates. I'd like to explore data about the job market and education levels to see if those are impacted by parent income. Likewise, external factors like industries or types of jobs are important to consider for each city. 

### Personal Importance
This is important to me, because addressing employment rates, especially amongst those with low-income parents, is critical to social mobility and thriving cities.
